= ram - 10 locations(use array) the locations are called registers
= each register holds a max of 1000 words of ram
= each location stores a value from 0-999
= whenever altering a value in a location set the value to value%1000
count the number of instructions being stored till the end of execution

instructions
100 - halt
2dn - set register d to n
3dn - add n to register d
4dn - multiply register d by n
5ds - set register d to the value of register s
6ds - add the value of register s to register d
7ds - multiply register d by the value of register s
8da - set register d to the value in RAM whose address is in register a
9sa - set the value in RAM whose address is in register a to that of register s
0ds - goto the location in register d unless register s contains 0

= parse instructions
interpret the instruction parsed
alter array accordingly
exit accordingly - clear RAM whenever this is done

array - fixed length(len 10)
